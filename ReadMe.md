These are a number of miscellaneous scripts that I've made to automate tasks.

learndir - move quickly to my Learning Projects Directory
workdir - move quickly to my Work Projects Directory
staff_transfer - move quickly to my Staff Transfer directory on networked server

toggleDevMode - From the current directory will change a setting in all JS files here and in subdirectories. Usage is toggleDevMode "var name" "delimiter plus any spaces between delim and value" "desired value"
